      <h1>Simply "Authentic" Italian</h1>
      <p>
        To experience authentic Italian cuisine without having to travel to
        Italy, make your way to La Perla Di Pompano!
      </p>
      <p>La Perla Di Pompano opened its doors in November of 2018.</p>
      <p>
        Lino Canzio and Manuela Maffezzoli started the restaurant, and under
        their direction, La Perla has proved to be an outstanding Italian
        Restaurant serving authentic Italian cuisine that embraces all regions
        of Italy, as Lino is from the south and Manuela from northern Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both Manuela and Lino graduated from an esteemed catering college (a
        culinary institute) in Italy, and come from a background of managing
        fine dining establishments throughout Europe, as well as a 5 star
        Italian Restaurant in Michigan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Manuela and her team combine their exceptional skills with the freshest
        local produce to create a variety of visually appealing, mouthwatering
        dishes that truly provide an Italian culinary experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        From your first step through the door, the fabulous aromas emerging from
        the kitchen will make you realize that you have just discovered
        Pompano's best kept secret. Portions are ample and reasonably priced.
      </p>

      <p>
        La Perla Di Pompano also offers an extensive wine list, featuring
        Italian wines for the most discerning tastes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prior to launching La Perla, Lino and Manuela owned and operated Il
        Posto Ristorante, in Hollywood, Florida. After five years of very
        satisfied customers and new friends, Manuela and Lino decided to
        continue their journey in Pompano Beach.
