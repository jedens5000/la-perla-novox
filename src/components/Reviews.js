I had the lobster stuffed ravioli with spinach & shrimp with marinara sauce. It was cooked perfectly, pasta done just right with melt in your mouth filling. And don't get me started on the fresh made daily dessert cart! The setting is lovely reminded me of my last trip to Siciliy and impeccable service. Bravo to chef Manuela and her front of the house team..üëèüëè I highly recommend it..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",

Delicious home made Tagliatelle with Calamari, Shrimp and Seafood.  Just when I thought the food couldn't be any better, I took a bite of the Veal Piccata.  That was truly the best veal dish I've ever had.  It was so tender and the perfect amount of lemon, butter sauce and capers.  Came with perfectly cooked spinach and potatoes. The entire experience was amazing.  Can't wait to return.",

      text: "No other Italian restaurant will ever compare.  AUTHENTIC! The service was impeccable, yet comfortable. Wine selection was awesome. Home made bread and desserts.  Holy Cannoli! Our Italian server was very knowledgeable. So many southern regional options.  Lobster ravioli,  chicken with an amazing sauce Florentine.  Our kids were with us and asked for a few things not mentioned on the menu and the waiter made them feel so special by giving them exactly what they wanted. Even slicing and serving their chocolate cake for them at the table.  We almost passed the place up, it's so tiny, but how lucky we were to find it. Coming from Cleveland very close to  Little Italy,  I don't think I will ever find anything close to home like this place. We had no reservation but the owner quickly came and set up a table for 5 of us. We could tell his restaurant is his pride and joy",
